<h2><strong>Status&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>This is a simple Python script that is a perceptron neural network. This is the first version of it and will become increasingly complex as I continue to update this project.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Simple synaptic weights, random seeds, training inputs using the sigmoid derivative. It uses a 3 by 1 matrix with a -1 bias. This script will also print the outputs of "synaptic weights after training" and "outputs after training."</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can also set the amount of iterations on line 23. Don't overdo it though or else your computer will be left processing for a while!</strong></p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p><strong>No known bugs at this time.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Version Number</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Version 0.0.1</strong></p>
